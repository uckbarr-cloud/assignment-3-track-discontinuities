# Assignment 3 — Analysis of Local Track Discontinuities

This project analyzes railway track condition data using machine learning.

## Objectives
- Detect track defects using extracted vibration features
- Train and evaluate an SVM model
- Perform feature selection to identify key indicators

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Cross-validation
- ANOVA feature selection

## Results
- Test Accuracy: 96.7%
- Mean Cross-validation Accuracy: 94.7%
- Key features: max, min, range, kurtosis, crest_factor
